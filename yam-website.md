Consisting of an informational landing page, a governance page that will display the onchain proposals as well to the possibility to create a simple proposal if you have the minimum tokens, a treasury page that shows the different balances of tokens owned by the treasury with charts and related statistics, a user page to show what the user has of yam tokens or any other yam project tokens, and a farm page showing clearly what we have to interact with and the how-to for accessibility. It will undergo an upgrade as well to a restructure, using the tools that we have and will be building such as the yam sdk, subgraph and api.
