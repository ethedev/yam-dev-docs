# **Yam Subgraph**

**Description:** The Yam Subgraph will be used as a way to query what that the yam smart contracts entails with ease, it will be used for specific calls through the API, the SDK and other places as well to 3rd party applications. As described: where all data is stored and processed on open networks with verifiable integrity, the yam subgraph will makes querying its data fast, reliable, and secure.

**Plan:** Yam Subgraph will cover the yam smart contracts read functions and events, with additional interesting data for collection, such as user, token and governance data relations.

1. **Development:** Development will include everything mentioned in the plan above, with details describing what every query endpoint relates to.
2. **Development Testing**: Developer testing will start, through manual and unit tests.
3. **Deployment:** API will be deployed and tested, with plans and preparations for automation.
4. **Automation:** Automated tests will be implemented to run on new version updates.
5. **Post Launch:** Curation is one of the things that we will look for at the right time after the deployment of the yam smart contracts.
6. **Maintenance:** Development will go through updates and bug fixes with additional features support and changes that we see fit to make products better.
