# **Yam SDK**

**Description:** The Yam SDK will be one of the tools used by multiple parties and dapps, its purpose is to make developers interact with yam easier. Main use will be on the yam website for features and interactions with smart contracts, and generally for any party interested in yam read/write data.

**Plan:** SDK to include everything you need related to yam, yam smart contracts interactions, with further helper functions as well to wrappers related to yam projects. It will interact programmatically with off-chain and on-chain data, with different public and private APIs, smart contracts and other tools we are building such as the yam subgraph.

3. **Deployment:** SDK will be deployed and tested, with plans and preparations for automation.
4. **Automation:** Automation will include full automated testing as well to special auto release deployments checkpoints.
5. **Maintenance:** Development will go through updates and bug fixes with additional features support and changes that we see fit to make products better.
